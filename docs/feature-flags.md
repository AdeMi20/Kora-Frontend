# Feature Flags

Kora gates optional/experimental surfaces behind a centralised, type-safe
feature-flag system ([`lib/featureFlags.ts`](../lib/featureFlags.ts), issue
#308). Every flag is backed by a `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_*` environment variable,
so the same build can be configured per deployment by env alone.

## Reading a flag in code

```ts
import { isEnabled, useFeatureFlag } from "@/lib/featureFlags";

if (isEnabled("secondary-market")) { ... } // non-component code

const enabled = useFeatureFlag("comparison"); // inside a component (reactive)
```

## Flag reference

Source of truth: `FLAG_ENV_MAP` in `lib/featureFlags.ts`. Env values are
compared against the literal string `"true"` — anything else is off.

| Flag                        | Env var                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `mock-data`                 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA`                 | Use static mock fixtures instead of live Soroban RPC calls. Also selects the app's **network mode** (`mock` vs `live`), which drives TanStack Query tuning via `getNetworkMode()` / `QUERY_TUNING` (#436). |

### Defaults

Two layers of default apply:

1. **Intrinsic (env unset).** Every flag defaults to `false` except
   `onboarding-tour`, whose guard is `val !== "false"` — it is **on unless the
   env var is literally `"false"`** (`lib/featureFlags.ts:70`).
2. **`.env.example`.** The checked-in example sets recommended dev values:
   `mock-data`, `devtools`, `comparison`, `batch-actions`, and
   `secondary-market` are `true`; `onboarding-tour` and `kyb-mint-gate` are
   `false`; `category-taxonomy-preview` is not listed (off). Copying
   `.env.example` to `.env.local` reproduces the standard dev setup.

## Overriding locally

### 1. Env var (`.env.local`)

Add or edit the variable in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SECONDARY_MARKET=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ONBOARDING_TOUR=false
```

Because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into the client bundle at
build/startup time, **restart `npm run dev`** after changing them. `.env.local`
takes precedence over `.env` and `.env.example`.

### 2. Runtime override panel (development only)

During development, the **Feature Flags** panel (bottom-left) toggles flags
without a restart. It is rendered by
[`components/dev/FeatureFlagPanel.tsx`](../components/dev/FeatureFlagPanel.tsx)
whenever `NODE_ENV === "development"` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS === "true"`.

- Overrides are stored under the localStorage key `kora:feature-flag-overrides`
  and take precedence over env values.
- The reset button clears all overrides (back to env values); toggling
  `mock-data` also invalidates active invoice queries.
- Runtime overrides are **ignored in production builds**
  (`canUseRuntimeOverrides()` gates on `NODE_ENV !== "production"`), so they are
  safe for local iteration only.

#### Restricted overrides on staging hosts (#1025)

Some flags switch the app between live and demo behaviour, which is easy to
confuse when a staging URL is shared externally. These are listed in
`DISALLOWED_OVERRIDE_FLAGS` (`lib/featureFlags.ts`) and can only be overridden
at runtime when `NODE_ENV === "development"`:

| Flag               | Why it is restricted                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mock-data`        | Would silently swap live Soroban data for mock fixtures.  |
| `secondary-market` | Would expose the P2P trading route on hosts that hide it. |

Outside development (staging, `test`, and any build where the panel is
enabled via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS`):

- `setFeatureFlagOverride()` is a no-op for these flags.
- Stored values for these keys are **ignored on read** — even if
  `kora:feature-flag-overrides` is edited by hand — and are dropped from
  storage the next time any override is written.
- The panel shows the toggle as disabled with a **locked** badge and a
  tooltip explaining the restriction.

The flags still follow their `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_*` env var everywhere, so set
the env var on the deployment (or in Playwright's `webServer.env`) instead of
relying on a localStorage override. E2E specs should only seed overrides for
non-restricted flags. Local `npm run dev` is unaffected: every flag remains
overridable.

`isFlagOverrideAllowed(flag)` reports whether a given flag can be overridden
in the current build.

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mock-data`                 | `getNetworkMode()` / `QUERY_TUNING` (`lib/featureFlags.ts`), invoice data sources (`lib/queryKeys.ts`)                              |
| `devtools`                  | `app/providers.tsx` (React Query devtools)                                                                                          |
| `comparison`                | `components/marketplace/ComparisonBar.tsx`, `ComparisonTable.tsx`, `components/invoice/InvoiceCard.tsx`, `app/marketplace/page.tsx` |
| `onboarding-tour`           | `components/onboarding/OnboardingTour.tsx`, `app/providers.tsx`                                                                     |

## Adding a new flag

1. Add the flag to the `FeatureFlag` union, `FEATURE_FLAGS`, and `FLAG_ENV_MAP`
   in `lib/featureFlags.ts`.
2. Add a description in `FLAG_DESCRIPTIONS` (`components/dev/FeatureFlagPanel.tsx`)
   so the runtime panel labels it.
3. Add the matching `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_*` row to `.env.example`, and update
   the table above.
