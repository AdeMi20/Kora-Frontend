# Design System

The Kora frontend uses a semantic, token-based design system built on Tailwind CSS, CSS custom properties, and Radix UI primitives.

## Source of truth

| Layer | Location |
| ----- | -------- |
| CSS tokens | `app/globals.css` (`:root` and `.dark` blocks) |
| Tailwind mapping | `tailwind.config.ts` |
| UI primitives | `components/ui/` |
| Domain components | `components/invoice/`, `components/wallet/`, etc. |

## Theming

- **Dark-mode-first** with light mode via the `class` strategy (`darkMode: ["class"]` in Tailwind).
- The persisted preference (`light` / `dark` / `system`) lives in `uiStore`; an inline bootstrap script in `app/layout.tsx` applies the resolved class before first paint to prevent FOUC.
- `lib/theme.ts` is the **single source of truth** for theme resolution: `resolveTheme()` is shared by the inline bootstrap script (`THEME_INIT_SCRIPT`) and `components/layout/ThemeProvider.tsx`, so the pre-paint class and the hydrated class can never drift when the OS switches color scheme. A unit test executes the script and compares its result against `resolveTheme` for every preference/OS combination.
- Color tokens are defined as **HSL components** (e.g. `--color-primary: 174 72% 40%`) and consumed as `hsl(var(--primary))` in Tailwind.

### Browser chrome color (`themeColor`)

The mobile browser UI bar (and PWA title bar) follows the resolved theme via `THEME_COLORS` in `lib/theme.ts`:

| Token | Value | Surface |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| `THEME_COLORS.light` | `#ffffff` | white page background |
| `THEME_COLORS.dark` | `#09090b` | zinc-950 dashboard background |

- `app/layout.tsx` exports a media-scoped `viewport.themeColor` (via `buildViewportThemeColor()`) so the server-rendered `<meta name="theme-color">` tags match the OS preference before hydration.
- After hydration, `ThemeProvider` calls `applyBrowserThemeColor(resolved)`, which forces the resolved color onto every `theme-color` tag — this is what makes an in-app override (e.g. OS light + user-picked dark) win over the OS preference.
- The manifest's `theme_color` / `background_color` (built in `lib/pwa/manifest.ts`) use the same dark token so the PWA install splash stays consistent. Keep them in sync via `THEME_COLORS`.

### PWA manifest localization

The manifest is served by the `/manifest.json` route handler (`app/manifest.json/route.ts`), not a static file, so it renders for the active `kora-locale`:

- Shortcut **names** reuse the translated navbar labels (`nav.marketplace`, `nav.createInvoice`) so a shortcut's title matches its destination.
- Shortcut `short_name`, descriptions and screenshot labels come from the `pwa.manifest` message namespace; missing keys fall back to English.
- Shortcut URLs are **locale-agnostic** app paths (`/marketplace`, `/invoice/create`). The locale lives in the `kora-locale` cookie, never in the URL, so localized manifests must not ship locale-prefixed shortcut paths.

## Token categories

### Color

Semantic tokens in `globals.css`:

- **Brand:** `--color-primary`, `--color-accent`
- **Surfaces:** `--color-surface`, `--color-surface-elevated`, `--color-surface-muted`
- **Text:** `--color-text`, `--color-text-muted`, `--color-text-subtle`
- **Feedback:** `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-destructive`, `--color-info`

Legacy shadcn-compatible aliases (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, etc.) map to the semantic tokens for compatibility with existing UI components.

### Spacing & typography

Spacing scale (`--space-1` … `--space-12`) and font sizes (`--font-size-xs` … `--font-size-3xl`) are defined in `globals.css` and referenced where needed for consistent rhythm.

## UI primitives

Reusable building blocks live under `components/ui/`. Every file in that folder is listed below with its purpose and when to use it. Prefer composing these primitives over one-off styles. Use `cn()` from `lib/utils` for conditional class merging.

### Form controls

| Primitive | File | Purpose | When to use |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `Button` | `button.tsx` | Primary CTA, secondary, ghost, danger variants with loading spinner, `asChild`, and `iconLabel` a11y support. | Any clickable action. Use `isLoading` for async submits; `iconLabel` for icon-only buttons. |
| `Input` | `input.tsx` | Text input with label, error, hint, and size variants. | Single-line text entry (debtor name, invoice number, search). |

| `PrintLayout` | `print-layout.tsx` | Print/PDF export wrapper with `@media print` rules and page-break controls. | Invoice PDF generation and print preview. |

### Feedback & state

| Primitive | File | Purpose | When to use |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `Badge` | `badge.tsx` | Status pill with color variants (default, secondary, destructive, outline, success, warning). | Risk tier, invoice status, live counts. |
| `Progress` | `progress.tsx` | Radix Progress bar with determinate value and accessible label. | Funding progress on invoice cards and detail. |
| `Skeleton` | `skeleton.tsx` | Animated placeholder block/circle for loading states. | Any async surface before data resolves. |

### Utilities & affordances

| Primitive | File | Purpose | When to use |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `CopyButton` | `CopyButton.tsx` | Copy-to-clipboard button with copied feedback, `useTranslations("copyButton")`, and tooltip. | Address, hash, share link, taxonomy copy. |
| `ShortcutBadge` | `ShortcutBadge.tsx` | Keyboard shortcut hint badge (`⌘K`, `?`, etc.). | Command palette, shortcut reference modal. |
| `index.ts` | `index.ts` | Barrel re-exports for the most commonly composed primitives. | Import via `components/ui` instead of deep paths. |

> **Note on `index.ts`:** the barrel currently re-exports `button`, `card`, `badge`, `skeleton`, `progress`, `input`, `textarea`, `number-input`, `date-picker`, `file-input`, `pagination`, `dialog`, `select`, `stat-card`, `data-table`, `CopyButton`, `Highlight`, `apr-display`, `drawer`, and `range-slider`. Other primitives (e.g. `bottom-sheet`, `breadcrumb`, `tooltip`, `EmptyState`) are imported via their direct paths — this is intentional and not a gap; extend the barrel only when a primitive is used widely enough to justify it.

## Storybook

Component stories live alongside components as `*.stories.tsx` files. Storybook
packages are **not currently wired** as an `npm run storybook` script — visual
coverage runs through the Vitest snapshot test instead. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Run the snapshot suite for stories:

```bash
npm run test -- __tests__/stories.snapshot.test.tsx
```

If you make intentional markup changes, regenerate the committed snapshots:

```bash
npm run test -- __tests__/stories.snapshot.test.tsx -u
```

Snapshots are stored in `__tests__/__snapshots__/` and must be committed with
your change.

- `npm run storybook` — dev server at `http://localhost:6006`
- `npm run build-storybook` — static build
- `npm run test -- __tests__/stories.snapshot.test.tsx` — Vitest snapshot coverage without a dev server

## Adding new tokens

1. Add the CSS variable to `:root` and `.dark` in `app/globals.css`.
2. Map it in `tailwind.config.ts` under `theme.extend`.
3. Use the Tailwind utility in components — avoid hard-coded hex values in feature code.

## Adding a new primitive

1. Create `components/ui/<name>.tsx` following the existing patterns (forwardRef where appropriate, `cn()` for classes, `aria-*` for a11y, `useTranslations` only when the primitive owns user-facing copy).
2. Add `components/ui/<name>.stories.tsx` with at least `Default` and one variant/accessibility story.
3. Export it from `components/ui/index.ts` if it is broadly reused; otherwise document its direct import path in the table above.
4. Update this inventory doc so the new primitive appears in the correct table.
